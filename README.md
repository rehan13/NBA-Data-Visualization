# NBA Data Visualizations

## Project Overview
This repository contains a series of visualizations analyzing NBA player and team statistics. The goal is to provide insights that can help coaches, team managers, and basketball enthusiasts understand player ages, team performances, and individual player statistics over various seasons.

## Visualizations
- **Viz 1**: Distribution of player ages across different positions.
- **Viz 2**: All-time top teams with the highest total 3-pointers made (3PM) in both the Eastern and Western Conferences.
- **Viz 3**: Trends in team-wise 3-point attempts (3PA) over the seasons.
- **Viz 4**: Highest assists per game across seasons.
- **Viz 5**: Efficiency of prolific playmakers based on the assist-to-turnover ratio.
- **Viz 6**: A detailed look at LeBron James' scoring performance across his career.
